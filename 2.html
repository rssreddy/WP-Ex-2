        <p>Astudy of COVID-19 patients in Iceland represents the largest effort yet to assess the body’s immunological response to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies generated to combat infection peaked in the two months following a positive diagnosis before plateauing for a further two months in more than 90 percent of recovered patients, the authors report.

        <div><p>Two experts who weren’t involved in the study described the behavior of antibodies over time in an accompanying editorial. “The first wave [of antibodies] is generated by early short-lived plasma cells . . . but this wave subsides rapidly after resolution of acute infection. The second wave is generated by a smaller number of longer-lived plasma cells that provide long-lived immunity,” the authors of the editorial report. “A rise and early decay of antibodies was observed in the Icelandic study, but with limited loss of antibodies at later time points, a finding that points to stable SARS-CoV-2 immunity for at least 4 months after infection.”
    
            To arrive at this conclusion, the authors sampled more than 30,000 people—roughly 15 percent of Iceland’s population—beginning in the early days of the pandemic in February and continuing into early July. They split their cohort into three groups: those who had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), people who had been exposed to the virus but not necessarily infected, and those without any known exposure.
            
            Each person was tested using six antibody assays, including two that targeted the entire suite of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies rather than a single type. A person was counted as a positive case if those two “pan-Ig” assays came back positive. </p></div>
